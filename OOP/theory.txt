OOP : Object Oriented Programming

class :- It is blue print for creating objects (defined using 'class' keyword).
object :- Instance of class (defined using any variable with value = className).
Constructor :- Used to initialize objects of class (defined using __init__() function).

- 4 important concepts
        |
        |--- Encapsulation
        |--- Abstraction
        |--- Inheritance
        |--- Polymorphism

Encapsulation : Bundling of data & methods that operate on data within one unit.
Abstraction   : Hiding complex implementations details & showing necessary features.
Inheritance   : Creating new class from existing ones, inherit fields & methods.
Polymorphism  : Ability to take many forms, allowing methods to do different, this is based on object it is acting upon.


# Access modifiers :- 
public : Accessible from any where. (self.<>)
protected : Accessible only within the class. (self._<>)
private : Accessible only within the class its subclass. (self.__<>)

# class method : The method that are bound to the class and not the instance
# @ : indicated it is a decorator
# static method : That do not receive an implicit first argument, We dont need object creation.
