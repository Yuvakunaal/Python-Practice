# break :- we will use break keyword maximum in loops to stop the looping process

# for i in range(1,10+1):
#     print(i)
#     if i==5:
#         break
#         print(100)

# Continue :-  The continue keyword is used within loops (such as for or while loops) to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.

# for i in range(1,5):
#     if i%2 == 0:
#         print(i,"inside if")

#     print(i,"Outside if")

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)
#     continue
#     print(999)


# pass :- the pass keyword is a placeholder that is used when a statement is required syntactically, but you don't want to execute any code.

# for i in range(6):
#     if i==2:
#         pass
#     else:
